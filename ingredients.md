*Butter: Unsalted butter that is softened to room temperature will cream perfectly with *the sugar.
*Sugar: Granulated white sugar is what works best.
*Eggs: I use 4 whole eggs in my cake recipes.
*Vanilla: Look for high-quality vanilla to use. I prefer Nielsen-Massey Madagascar *Bourbon Pure Vanilla or you can make your own vanilla.
*Flour: Bob's Red Mill Super Fine Cake Flour is the best and will ensure the cake has the best texture.
*Leavening: Baking powder is used to give the cake rise.
*Salt: Salt helps to balance the sweetness.
*Milk: Whole milk works best but you can also use buttermilk.
